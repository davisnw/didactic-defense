  <h1>Didactic Defense</h1>
  <p>
  A guided tour on your journey to developing Secure Web Applications.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Don't be Evil</h2>
  <p>The intent of this work is to demonstrate how to defend your web application against security breaches.  This knowledge is a double-edged sword - the same knowledge needed to defend your application could also be used to attack another system.</p>
  
  <p>
  You should never use this knowledge to attack systems other than your own, unless you have entered into a signed, legal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Ethical_Hacker">"ethical hacking"</a> agreement with the targeted party. Doing otherwise may expose you to legal risks, including fines and jail time.

  <h2>Code Samples</h2>
  <p>This work also references code samples contained in the same git repository as this content. Creative Commons discourages applying their licenses to source code.  Therefore, the source code contained in this work is licensed under <strong>TBD</strong></p>
  
  <p>Be aware that many of the code samples in this repository are <strong>intentionally insecure</strong> in order to demonstrate a particular vulnerability.  Therefore <strong>you should be very careful about reusing code in these examples to ensure that your are only using "patched" code for production systems.</strong></p>
  
  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  The concepts in this work apply broadly to all sorts of web technologies, however, the focus of most examples is ASP.NET MVC, and Microsoft SQL Server.  Therefore, if you want to follow along with the code examples, you should have a copy of Sql Server Express and Visual Studio 2010 or later.
